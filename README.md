# Mini Project 4 

This week, I focused on learning how to use the `actix` crate and its functions. Based on the path provided by the user, the service will either print a welcome message, return a random top swimmer, or return the version of cargo that is being used. I wanted to use this as a starting point for when I work on my second individual project.
